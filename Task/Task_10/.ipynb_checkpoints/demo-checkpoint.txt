Once upon a time in a faraway land, there lived an old wise owl.
He often observed the happenings around him and remained silent.
One day, a young rabbit approached him and asked, "Why do you remain so quiet?"
The owl replied, "Wisdom comes from listening more and speaking less."
The rabbit pondered over these words and decided to follow the advice.
As days passed, the rabbit noticed that he learned more by observing than by talking.
This realization changed his way of thinking and improved his knowledge.
